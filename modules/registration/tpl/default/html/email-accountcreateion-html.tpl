What’s cookin’ good lookin’?!

Congratulations!  With your new MSQC account you’ve officially been inducted into an elite squadron of quilting ninjas.  Your training and preparation in the art of quilting have clearly paid off!  Here is your login info:

Remember though, not everyone gets one of these accounts, and with great power comes great responsibility.  

With this account, you have been entrusted with a sacred duty, namely to ALWAYS login when you come to our site.  Why?  This is why: 

1) The only way to earn and spend Quilter’s Cash is to be logged in  If you don’t you’re basically throwing away free money (to learn more about Quilter’s Cash, click here)
2) You can check out with lightning speed (and the stealth and grace of a true quilting ninja)
3) When logged in, you have access to our awesome Quilting Forums, QuiltsByMe.com, and Quilting Tutorials.

Oh ya, one more duty we forgot to mention … you must check the daily deal every day and talk yourself into buying it, then out of buying it because you have  way too much fabric, then back into buying again.

With this solemn commitment to the art of ninja quilting, we now knight you Sir/Siress ____ 

Respectfully,
The Board of Quilting Ninjas at the Missouri Star Quilting Company.
